# ILP
Implementing ILP on weighted independent dominating problem
I Implement ILP based on the proposed method in "The Weighted Independent Domination Problem: Integer Linear Programming Models and Metaheuristic Approaches"
The aricle has 3 kinds of ILP3 , 2 Greedy and 2 other population based methods for solving the problem. Here is the ILP implementation
